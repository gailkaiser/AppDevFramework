# Serverless Service-Oriented Application

This section turns the server based service oriented  application that was previously built into a standalone serverless Service Oriented Application. In other words, each feature (or service) that was previously built and hosted on its own server, is now converted into Lambda functions hosted on AWS. This "serverless" technology is one of the most effective SOA models in the upcoming age, due to its cost and scalability benefits. 

#### The Orchestrator

The Orchestrator is the first component of this architecture but will be the last to be completed. The orchestrator facilitates communication between the User Interface as well as among all the different services that make up the application.
