# Application Development Framework

### Application development framework to that sets up three different architectures for a Flask application: monolithic, service-oriented with servers, and service-oriented without servers.

## Framework Details
Each architecture is separated into its own subfolder in this repository. Each application structure is set up to run once the user fills in the dummy functions. Files needed for setting up continuous integration with TRAVIS CI are also included in the subfolders.
