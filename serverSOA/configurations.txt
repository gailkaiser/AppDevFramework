<This is the configurations file - any hard coded parameter such as an API Key or a Port or host, etc. goes here>

<If this file contains required API Keys DO NOT commit it to the repository. Instead, just add it to the .gitignore for safety>

<ConfigParser uses this file to determine which keys go where, based on the "section" it lies under. The syntax for how sections are split can be seen below>

<To use config parser to parse the following keys, you must pass in the Section and Key as shown in the template code>
